# manualblue
## A variant of [AutoBlue-MS17-010](https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010) by [3ndG4me](https://github.com/3ndG4me/), modified even further for OSCP compliance.

### Version: 0.5:
- This version is not working entirely, use at your own risk (incorrect method of starting/stopping of msf/postgres).
    - You may try skipping the step where you start your listeners in MSF, and instead start them seperately using nc.
    - Pull requests welcome
